# MCPEiOSTestMod

This is the MCPE iOS Mod that works in 0.16.2.

Of course, it is possible to create a Mod in the latest version using this method, but it would be very difficult to create a Mod in 1.13 and above because the function names are no longer available even in the Android version of Bedrock.
